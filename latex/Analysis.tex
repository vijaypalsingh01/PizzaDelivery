\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The input will be\+: The Pizza and the delivery address will be input by the user and the user will be able to click the order button to place the order. The program then calls back appropriate functions associated to the order button. The user is also required to input the drivers manually for the first time and click the add button to add the driver and then they are added automatically after they are done delivering.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The output will be\+: The alerts that F\+L\+T\+K shows after the order is placed have the input values from the user. Once the order is cooked there is another alert that shows that order is cooked. Then the driver's name, the pizza, and the delivery address shows up when it is ready to deliver. There is another alert stating the driver is back from delivery once he or she is back from delivery. Along with the alerts, there is also an output of 3 Queues which are updated everytime something is removed or inserted. The program uses a function from the Queue class to show all the data in the F\+L\+T\+K Queue boxes. There is also a small clock which manages the time.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The overall Algorithim is\+: The program uses call back functions to run. Ather the user inputs the drivers name, the user is required to press the add button which class the driver\+\_\+cb function and adds the driver in the R\+B\+Queue. After the pizza and the address input the user is required to click the order button, which calls back the order\+\_\+cb and puts the order into the L\+L\+Queue. After few seconds the cook\+\_\+cb function is called which removes the order from the Order\+Q and places it in the cooked\+Q. It then calls the delivery\+\_\+cb which removes the driver and the cooked order and send it delivery. If there are no drivers the programs keeps checking for the drivers in the queue and sends the order once it is ready. the driver is added to a temp R\+B\+Q when he or she is out for delivery and then gets removed from the temp and added to the drivers Q when he or she comes back from delivery. \end{DoxyItemize}
